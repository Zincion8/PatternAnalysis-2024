# YOLOv7 ISIC Lesion Detection

## Problem Description
Detect lesions in the ISIC 2017/8 dataset using YOLOv7. The goal is to achieve a minimum Intersection Over Union (IoU) of 0.8 on the test set.

## Model
The YOLOv7 detection network will be used with transfer learning on the pre-trained weights. Fine-tuning will be performed on the ISIC dataset.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- YOLOv7
- OpenCV
